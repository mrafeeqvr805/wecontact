# Wecontact
"weContact" distinguishes itself as an innovative, relevant, and user-friendly initiative intricately designed to simplify contact management for every user. Featuring an uncomplicated interface coupled with robust features, weContact seamlessly facilitates storing, editing, categorizing, searching, sorting, and deleting user contacts—all with just a few clicks.

An additional highlight of "weContact" is its unwavering commitment to user data security. The project incorporates a secure login and signup process, ensuring that only authorized users gain access to their personalized home pages. This stringent authentication protocol effectively prevents unauthorized access and fortifies user information against potential third-party intrusion.

Moreover, prioritizing data privacy, "weContact" has implemented rigorous measures to keep user contacts confidential and shielded from external entities. The handling of sensitive information, including user passwords, is executed with utmost care, with passwords stored in the database only after being hashed—an unreadable format for potential intruders, even administrators without access to these details.

Taking security a step further, the project employs salting, adding random characters to passwords before hashing. This additional layer of protection virtually precludes hackers from deciphering passwords, significantly enhancing overall security. During the login process, password comparison using the same hashing technique ensures that access to the home page is granted only to authorized users.

To enhance user-friendliness, a 'forgot password' section has been incorporated, allowing users to reset their passwords by receiving an OTP to their registered email in case of forgotten credentials.

The project includes robust validation measures. In the login/signup sections, invalid email syntax is promptly flagged as an error. Passwords are required to meet specific criteria, ensuring strength—having at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, one special character, and a minimum length of 8 characters.

On the home page, to prevent duplicate contact cards, the program verifies new contact details against the database, generating a new card only if no duplicate details exist. This approach minimizes confusion and reduces space complexity.

In the "weContact" project, we leverage MongoDB as our database, Node and Express for our backend, and EJS view engine and Tailwind for frontend development—robust and stable platforms.
